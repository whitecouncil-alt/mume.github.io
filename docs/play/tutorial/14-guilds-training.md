# Training at the Warrior Guild

Refreshed from his rest, Fuor visits the retired warrior who trains newcomers. As you earn experience and travel points you gain practice sessions - spend them to learn skills. `prac` shows what you can learn; `prac <skill>` trains it. The better you know a skill, the more effective you become. Guilds are marked with a "G" on the map.
