# Recovery by the Fire

Safely back inside **The Foaming Mug**, Fuor and Irelm sit by the peat fire. `rest` accelerates recovery, `drink water` and `eat biscuit` keep hunger and thirst at bay, and `stand` stands you back up. To recover even faster you can `sleep` - but you are vulnerable to attack while asleep, so choose your room wisely! Tip: resting or sleeping in a room with a bed or a fire recovers you quicker; you can make a fire with the `camp` command. Use `wake` to wake up from sleep.
