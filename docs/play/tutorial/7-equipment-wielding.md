# Arming for the Road

Carrying armor and weapons in a pack offers no protection-Fuor must don his jerkin (`wear jerkin`), hold his backsword (`wield backsword`), and fasten his wooden shield (`wear shield`).

Arm Fuor for the road ahead by inspecting his `equipment` and `inventory`, then donning his gear below!
