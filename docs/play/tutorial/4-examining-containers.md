# Managing your Items

Sitting at a simple oaken table in the beer garden, Fuor prepares his supplies for the road ahead. Detailed inspection uses `examine`, while pack organization follows `get <item> <container>` and `put <item> <container>`.

Help Fuor examine the table, unpack his travel cheese, and stow it securely by typing `examine table`, `get cheese sack`, and `put cheese sack` below!
