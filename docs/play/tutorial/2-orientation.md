    Welcome to MUME!

    Your first step here is to create an ACCOUNT.

    MUME characters are organized into accounts. You can only have ONE ACCOUNT, and
    it cannot be shared with other players. You can create as many characters as
    you like, but they must all belong to this single account.

    Do you have another account on MUME [Y/N/?]?

# The Awakening of Fuor

For this walkthrough you borrow the boots of **Fuor**, a ready-made young warrior - a stand-in so you can try each command without setting anything up.

Our story begins in **the Black Hills**, a rugged country of rolling slopes, ancient tracks, and quiet hamlets in Eriador, where Fuor awakens in the Common Room of The Foaming Mug.

### Understanding MUME Accounts
When you connect to MUME for the first time, you register a single **Account**. All your characters - whether human warriors, elven clerics or hobbit scouts - are organised safely under this one account with a single password.
