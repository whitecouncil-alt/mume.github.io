# Encounter in the Black Hills

Irelm and Fuor march out into the rocky slopes of the Black Hills. Suddenly, a wild slithering snake bounds onto the trail! Irelm urges Fuor to gauge the snake's strength (`consider snake`), switch to an offensive stance (`change mood aggressive`), strike (`hit snake`), and balance his defense (`change mood wimpy`).

Guide Fuor through his first real-time combat engagement below!
