    Inn's Private Rooms
    Rows of simple wooden doors leading to the guest rooms are accessed from a long
    corridor behind a small counter. A small brass bell rests on the counter to
    summon the innkeeper if he is away from his post. Covering the floor is a
    threadbare rug which, although worn, deadens the noise coming from below.
    The innkeeper set is here, smiling at would-be customers.
    Exits: north, down.
    The innkeeper says 'Welcome to the largest inn in Black Hill village! I have never run out of rooms.'

# Securing the Night at the Inn

Simply disconnecting in the wild drops your equipment. **To save your equipment and character**, head `up` to the **Inn's Private Rooms**, `examine innkeeper`, ask the rate with `offer`, then `rent`. There are many inns around Middle-earth - look for the "R" on the map. Remember: always `rent` at the end of a session!
